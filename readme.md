# Event Center Assignment

This was a tough one. I had to rebuild it a few times, made some really newbie mistakes... but I was committed to writing everything out. I am sure there is probalby some css properties that are extraneous and possibly a few no-so-best practices, but at this point everything works!

## AI Usage Disclosure

no copy and paste from AI was used, although I got answers to a lot of my questions through a few different AI platforms to make this one work.

Cheers!
